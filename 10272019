start pose change to
```
Cartesian position is: [0.211940020323, -0.27501475811, 0.496133089066]
Cartesian orientation in Euler-XYZ(degree) is: 
tx 63.6, ty 82.3, tz 4.0
```


current limitation is
'''
The arm is too far from the object (0.8m), arm can be only reach to around 0.9 m
based on testing camera focus less than 0.5m still get good data so we change the distance between arm and structure. 


The other issue we found is the motion of robotic arm are different for the width and the length because the distance change. 
our first plan was that we placing diagonal space apart same distance along the width and Length of the object. 
but has to be different allowing arm to move and keep our camera in the same distance from the object 
```
testing

what I found is that adjanct motion ( movement connection is important to avoid collision
